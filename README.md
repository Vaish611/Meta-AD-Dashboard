# Meta-AD-Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project is about analyzing Meta (Facebook and Instagram) Ads data to understand how different ad campaigns are performing. The main focus is on ad spend, clicks, conversions, and overall results. Power BI is used to visualize the data in an interactive way. The project helps in identifying which ads are effective. It supports better marketing decisions using data.

### KPI Questions
1.Which campaign gives the highest conversions?
2.What is the cost per click and cost per conversion?
3.Which ads provide the best return on investment?
4.How does ad performance change over time?
5.Which campaign wastes the most budget?

### Process:
The Meta Ads data was collected in CSV format and loaded into Power BI. Data cleaning and transformation were done using Power Query. Important measures such as CTR, CPC, and ROI were created using DAX. Different visuals like cards, charts, and tables were added. Finally, an interactive dashboard was designed.

### Project Insights:
The analysis showed that some campaigns had high ad spend but very low conversions. Ads with lower CPC were found to perform better overall. A small number of ad sets contributed to most of the conversions. Engagement levels were higher on certain days. These insights highlight where improvements are needed.
